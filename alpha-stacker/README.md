Alpha Stacker

Instructions

For this exercise, you need to create a single JavaScript function named stackLetters that will use console.log() to print out letters in the alphabet to the browser console.

If you haven't done so yet, create the workspace/exercises/alpha-stacker directory structure in your home directory. Open your terminal and enter in the following command.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/exercises/alpha-stacker
Now that you have created the directory, you want to change to that directory so that you can add files to it.

cd ~/workspace/exercises/alpha-stacker
Create an index.html file with the touch command.

Create an alpha-stacker.js file with the touch command.
Copy the following code and paste it into the index.html file. Notice that the alpha-stacker.js file is properly linked so that when you load this HTML file in a web browser, the logic in that file will be executed.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Alpha Stacker</title>
</head>
<body>

    <script src="alpha-stacker.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

At this point, you will simply see a blank web page because you have no content in the HTML file. Open your developer tools using the Option+Command+I keyboard shortcut.
At the top of the developer tools panel, you will see the word Console. Click on that word. The console.log() statement will output any message into this panel in your developer tools. You can try it out immediately by clicking in the Console panel, and typing console.log("Hello, world!"), and then pressing your return key.
Stacking Letters

Create a stackLetters function that should console.log() rows of letters. It should take an array containing the letters of the alphabet and output them in the developer console.

a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
abcdef
etc...
Starter code for alpha-stackers.js
// Create an array that contains the letters of the alphabet
var alphabet = [];

// The stackLetter function should accept the array as the sole argument
function stackLetters (theAlphabetArray) {
    /*
      Write a `for` loop that iterates over the array argument and
      outputs the letters.
     */
}

// Invoke the function and pass in the array
stackLetters(alphabet)
Adding Conditions to the Loop

Then add logic to stackLetters that places a space after every third letter. This will require you to do some basic math in JavaScript, and use an if statement.

Your job is to read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work.

If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 - using the JavaScript remainder operator - then add a single space to the output.
a
ab
abc
abc d
abc de
abc def
abc def g
abc def gh
abc def ghi
etc...
