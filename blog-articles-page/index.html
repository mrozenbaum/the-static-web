			<h1>Mobile Tech That Died in 2016 - Second Part: Google Nexus Smartphones and Project Ara</h1>
		</header>	
			<p>
			2017 marks the new era in mobile technology and yet it is hard to shake off the nostalgic feel of 2016 where few of these tech died alongside the coming of new year. Our previous MobileNApp article lists Pebble Smartwatch, Samsung Galaxy Note7 and BlackBerry phones as fatalities of 2016. Now here are additional well-known mobile techs that we will never see again. Google Nexus phones will always be remembered as harbinger of solid yet affordable Android experience. Greenbot headline reads in short catchy line: Google's Nexus is dead. Yes, the tech giant announced in October 2016 that fans will never see Nexus brand again.

			While Google Nexus' replacement brand Pixel is just fine and can even rival Apple's iPhone, this successor came at premium price point. The latter is simply a phone outside of mass appeal of Google Nexus. At any rate, Google will continue to provide update for Nexus so we can still buy them at a cheap for sheer reason that it is getting wiped off the face of the earth anyway.

			Would you like your phone to be modular in a sense that when a component breaks, you can simply buy a replacement instead of buying a whole phone altogether? This is the concept behind another Google heartbreak in 2016 - Project Ara. According to PC World, Project Ara was finally scrapped by Google and fast phone cycle was blamed as reason behind its demise.

			It is time to forget the idea of Lego-styled smartphone and interchangeable parts or upgrades that Project Ara offered. Let us just say that it is time for Project Ara dreamers to ultimately wake up.

			<h1>Tesla Narrowly Misses 80,000-Vehicle Sales Goal in 2016</h1>
				
		</header>
			<p>
			Tesla Motors Inc.’s fourth-quarter sales rose 27%—but not enough for the Silicon Valley auto maker to reach its goal of delivering at least 80,000 vehicles in 2016.

			The Palo Alto, Calif., company sold 22,200 vehicles during the October-through-December period, compared with 17,478 a year earlier, Tesla said Tuesday. The company sold a total of 76,230 cars and sport-utility vehicles last year.

			Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk was aiming for a strong finish to 2016 to help keep investor confidence ahead of the introduction this year of the new Model 3, a $35,000 sedan intended to broaden Tesla’s business beyond luxury cars and SUVs.

			Shares of Tesla fell more than 2% to $212.18 in after-hours trading Tuesday.
			Mr. Musk, who is also the chairman and largest shareholder of Tesla, has a habit of setting ambitious goals and timelines and missing them. He has said Tesla would make 500,000 cars a year by the end of 2018 and 1 million vehicles in 2020. The company is a long way off from that mark. Last year, Tesla produced nearly 84,000 vehicles.

			Tesla began 2016 with ambitions of delivering 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles. The first half started off slow with complications around the new Model X sport-utility vehicle. Orders ran at an all-time high during the fourth quarter, the auto maker said. But Tesla couldn’t make the vehicles fast enough to head off delays that arrived after introducing new hardware to vehicles beginning in late October for Autopilot, the semiautonomous driving feature.

			Autopilot has proven to be a thorny issue for Tesla after the driver of a Model S died last year when the car crashed into the side of a truck while using the semiautonomous driving system. U.S. regulators are investigating the matter, and Tesla has since made improvements to the software that it says likely would have prevented the crash.

			The new Autopilot hardware is aimed at making the system more advanced, eventually allowing the cars to become fully self-driving once the software is ready.

			Because of the hardware delays, Tesla said production was weighted more heavily toward the end of the quarter, affecting deadlines to ship cars to Europe and Asia.

			About 2,750 vehicles weren’t counted as sold in the quarter because of last-minute delays transporting them or the customer couldn’t physically take delivery, Tesla said. “Although we tried to recover these deliveries and expedite others by the end of the quarter, time ran out before we could deliver all customer cars,” the company said.


			Tesla doesn’t count a car sold until it is delivered to a customer, even if it was already paid for in advance.

			Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, doesn’t think Tesla will be ready with the Model 3 this year, saying in a note to investors last month that late 2018 is more likely.

			“We have taken this conservative approach to allow for the probability that Tesla will choose to prioritize the quality, cost, performance and lifesaving technology of the vehicle,” Mr. Jonas wrote.

			<h1>Samsung Unveils TVs With QLED Technology; What Makes It Different?</h1>
		</header>

			<p>
			Samsung recently unveiled an all-new line of televisions it calls QLED, and while the picture quality has gotten better, it's the new series' design that makes the biggest change of this year. QLED replaces Samsung's two-year outdated SUHD line as the company's most premium TV line, and it counted several meaningful upgrades. QLED offers better-viewing angles, brighter high dynamic range (HDR) performance and increased color production, with claimed advance to black levels as well.QLED could be the next big thing in TV market. Samsung, the world's no.1 TV maker, has confirmed that it's working on developing QLED TVs for the commercial market while continuing to deny its plans to mass-produce OLED. That leaves Samsung's rival LG as the only manufacturer of OLED, and Samsung itself with plenty of motivation to work on an alternative like QLED. The QLED technology will be available on the maker's upcoming Q9, Q8 and Q7 ranges, but release dates and prices have yet to be confirmed.The design has enhanced as well, now user can mount a Samsung QLED TV smack up against the wall. With Samsung's proprietary arising system, its Q9, Q8, and Q7 QLED TVs can be arisen (mounted) flush, making the TV look more like a piece of art than a television. If the user did not want to mount on the wall, Samsung offers two types of table-top stands with modern styling, crafted from stainless steel. An easel-style floor stand offers an uber-style option for those who want their TV to take center place in their room. Now there's a new TV technology in the market called QLED, and it might be even better than OLED, which is short for "quantum dot light emitting devices". QLED has the potential to match the "infinite" contrast ratio of OLED, with greater power efficiency, better color and more.
