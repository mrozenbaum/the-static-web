			<h2 style="color: blue">Apple, Carl Zeiss Partnering For Smart Glasses:</h2>
		<section>	
				<p>
				It seems like the world’s largest tech company could be jumping into the smart glasses game, according to an anonymous tip from a Carl Zeiss employee. Famed tech blogger and entrepreneur Robert Scoble broke the tip on his Facebook page. According to Scoble, the German optics manufacturer might announce a “light pair of augmented/mixed reality glasses” this year as part of a collaboration with Apple.
				<br>
				Scoble said that he pressed Zeiss representatives to tip their hand. Previously, Apple was rumored to be preparing AR tech for a 2018 launch, but Scoble is confident that the set will release later this year.
				<br>
				Rumors about an Apple-made version of the Google Glass or Microsoft’s HoloLens have been floating around for a couple years now, so it’s probable that the company’s been working on smart glasses for some time and could be nearing a release-ready gadget.
				<br>
				If Apple’s patent filing from last June is any indication, we could be getting a flexible, AMOLED-driven translucent screen that wraps around the user’s head. Alternatively, the patent includes a process which would allow a lens to deform and then return to its original shape. That means we may even see eye glass frames that will accept modified lenses that could popped in and out as needed without damaging the transparent AMOLED display.
				<br>
				While a good chunk of people on earth have readily adopted smart phones, other wearables have been slow to pick up steam. Google Glass didn’t do super well, and its users took a lot of flak for being a bit out of touch. Like it or not though, Apple’s been something of a trendsetter, and while they’re often among the last to get some things to market, when Apple does launch a new device, it tends to do pretty well. So it’s possible that Apple’s move could be the big push AR glasses need to go mainstream.
				<br>
				Technically, this is all rumors and hearsay, but given how these things tend to go, I’d say it’s a good bet Apple’s got something cooking.
				<br>
				For now, I’m just wondering how weird and pretentious the company will get with the name. Maybe iSpecs? Or iS (said “eyes”)? WHO KNOWS.

		<section>
				<p>
				You don’t need a special kind of beer to get drunk in the shower. But if someone has gone through the trouble to brew one specifically for that purpose it seems rude not to.
				<br>
				Who dreamed up this improbable libation? Creative types at Snask, an advertising agency based in Stockholm, teamed up with Sweden’s Pang Pang Brewery.
				<br>
				The result of their collaboration is called Shower Beer, because when you’re heading to the shower, there’s no time to hunt around the fridge for the right beer to take along. It’s got to jump out at you, and clearly, the one that says Shower Beer on the bottle is the one you’re going to reach for.
				<br>
				The inevitable result of pounding one too many Shower Beers in the shower.

				What makes Shower Beer special? Not necessarily the beer itself, though feedback from people who sampled the first batch of this pale ale was certainly positive.
				<br>
				The bottle itself is one thing. At just 6 ounces, it’s just over half the size of a Red Stripe stubby. Why so small? It’s so you can drink it before it has time to warm up in the shower, of course! Six ounces means you can down a Shower Beer in three swigs, says Pang Pang.
				<br>
				The other thing is the 10% alcohol content. Shower Beer packs quite a punch, so even though you’re drinking a relatively small amount you’re not giving any of the buzz you’d get from a more standard beer in a more standard bottle.
				<br>
				While this particular Shower Beer might not be available stateside, there is a Shower Beer you might be able to get your hands on. Champion Brewing in Charlottesville, Virginia makes one. It’s a Czech-style pilsner in a 12-ounce can with an ABV of 4.5%.
				<br>
				It’s rated quite highly on Beer Advocate, and you can drink it in the shower, too. At least I assume so. Champion doesn’t say you can’t on their website or anything…

			<h2 style="color: green">Your Dog’s Grey Fur May Not Be Due To Old Age:</h2>
		<section>
				<p>
				If you’ve ever noticed your doggy companion’s fur gradually turning grey or white, you’re not alone. And it’s a real thing that’s happening. But it might not be due to aging. It could instead be due to stress, which could be a lot scarier, in fact.
				<br>
				Stress and anxiety can, in fact, affect humans’ hair and give them plenty of premature grey. It seems that a new study has found similar results when it comes to dogs, with many of them gaining grey muzzles in contrast to their calmer, less anxious canine counterparts, according to research by animal behaviorist Camille King. King noticed that dogs she saw for various problems with anxiety and other similar issues were going grey a lot sooner than other dogs.
				<br>
				King put together a study where she and colleagues ended up photographing 400 young dogs from 1 to 4 years old, found from visits to dog shows and dog parks and had owners fill out questionnaires about the dogs’ anxiety, fear, and impulsivity levels. The surveys would ask whether or not the dogs had issues with whining or barking when alone at home or other behavioral problems like hiding or cowering when at the vet being examined.
				<br>
				The data was soon examined, and researchers found that dogs who were more anxious and showing signs of impulsivity tended to have more grey fur around their snout despite their age, size, medical issues, or if they were spayed or neutered already. The dogs that were particularly more afraid of loud noises or strangers were good predictors of which ones would have more grey fur.
				<br>
				It just goes to show you how similar the connections are with animals and humans are a lot more similar than you might have thought before. Dogs get stressed, too. It’s always worth making sure our furry friends are happy, safe, and comfortable to keep them from having to deal with things we go through when we have anxiety.

			<h2 style="color: orange">Razer’s Crazy Triple-display Laptop Was Stolen From Their CES Booth:</h2>
		<section>	
				<p>
				Razer’s chunky, mind-blowing Project Valerie laptop and its three 4K displays were one of the most impressive pieces of hardware at CES this year. So impressive someone decided to steal it.
				<br>
				At around 2 am Eastern time, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan announced on his Facebook page that he’d just receive word of the crime. The company’s groundbreaking laptop wasn’t the only thing that the thief (or thieves) took, either.
				<br>
				The perpetrator(s) also made off with another Razer prototype: Project Ariana. It’s a projector, but not like any you’ve ever used before. Project Ariana is a 4K unit with a pair of depth-sensing cameras and a fisheye lens, and it’s very similar to what Microsoft showed off with their IllumiRoom concept device for the Xbox.
				<br>
				Unlike Project Valerie — which you can only drool over for now — Razer was already planning on letting you buy Project Ariana. Though they don’t have a definite date, the projector was due to go on sale sometime later this year.
				<br>
				Tan is understandably ticked about the two prototypes being stolen. “At Razer, we play hard, and we play fair,” he posted, adding “our teams worked months on end to conceptualize and develop these units.”
				<br>
				Authorities are already investigating the crime, and Tan isn’t ready to rule out industrial espionage. That, he says, “is cheating, and cheating doesn’t sit well with us.”
				<br>
				He’s probably also not thrilled about history repeating itself. Back in 2011, Razer had a pair of prototypes stolen from their Bay Area offices during a break-in.

			<h2 style="color: red">CES 2017 Tech That Will Save and/or Ruin the World:</h2>
		<section>	
				<p>
				A new year means new technology, and for a concentrated dose of new technology look no further than the Consumer Electronics Show. Held annually in Las Vegas, CES is E3 for the tech journalism world. Instead of seeing new games every January we see new phones and computers and whatever new appliance we can make “smart.”
				<br>
				Technology has always played a crucial role in the world. It’s one of the best ways to mark our progress (or lack thereof) as a culture. But these days, with the world seemingly on the brink, we’re more sensitive to the effects of tech than ever before. Tech can help or hurt, or maybe do both at the same time. To manufacturers, it doesn’t really matter of tech saves the world or ruins it. It just needs to have an influence. It needs to be important. When you’re the Next Big Thing, like a smart hairbrush or a VR Hypersuit or a laptop with three screens, the absolute worst thing to be meaningless.
